# Comic Release Finder
A simple app to find what was released on a given Wednesday. It's mainly geared toward recent releases, especially finding out what is/will be released in the current week.

The search field accepts several date formats. It will let you know if it doesn't like the one you choose. There are a couple examples as placeholders. It's just using Ruby's `Date.parse` so anything that works there will work here.

All the information this app supplies is being scraped from [Comicbook Round Up](http://comicbookroundup.com/) so head on over there for more information.

Future development plans include *a lot* of styling, and some sort of user system to keep track of pull lists and/or favorites.
